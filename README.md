**Student • Intermediate Programmer • Aspiring Developer**

I’m a 16-year-old student who loves learning programming and building small projects.  
This GitHub profile is where I share my learning journey and track my progress step by step.

I’m currently focusing on learning, practicing, and improving my skills.  
My dream is to travel, grow as a developer, and become someone I’m proud of.
