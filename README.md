**Student • Intermediate Programmer • Aspiring Developer**

I’m a 16-year-old student who enjoys learning programming and building small projects.  
This GitHub profile is a place where I share what I learn and track my progress step by step.

I’m not looking for a job right now — I’m focused on learning, practicing, and improving my skills.  
My dream is to travel, develop myself, and become someone I’m proud of.
